## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   The Gaming Room client was looking for collaboration in expanding their already existing game called, "Draw It or Lose It." The Gaming Room requested that the application have one or more teams involved with each team having multiple players assigned to them. They also requested that each game and team name to be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a name. They only wanted one instance of the game to exist in memory at any given time. The Gaming Room believes that this should be attainable by given each game, team, and member a unique identifier.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
   I think the thing I did best was making the appropriate reccommendations to the client based on the information in the document. I was able to do this by extapolating from the UML diagram and the development requirements table.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I think the most helpful thing from this document was the UML diagram. This helped visualize the entities and their attributes which would help make developing the code easier.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I think I would revisit the design constraints and add in some more technical restraints of the software instead of constraints to the overall project. I wouldn't remove anything from this section, just expand on it more.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I tried to visualize the game as if I were playing it and determined what the user experience would be in this regard. I think it's important to take in user feedback since the user(s) is the primary person insteracting with the software. As a player of the game, they might make suggestions that The Gaming Room did not consider.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I took my time with curating the document and troubleshooting the code. I also referenced a few places like GitHub, Stack OVerflow, and Stack Exchange for things that was absolutely stumped on when troubleshooting the code. It was nice to see other programmers or people knowledgeable in the field, answer my questions. They usually provided an explanantion of why something isn't working or what to look for. I think it's helpful to plan out a project like this with UML diagrams. I am a visual learner and seeing the entities with their corresponding attributes is really helpful.
